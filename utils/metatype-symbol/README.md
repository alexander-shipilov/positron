This package provides a unique symbol to prevent tag symbols duplication when
multiple versions of a `meta-type` package coexist in a project's dependency
tree. Such duplication would cause ambiguity when using the `MetaType` type.
This is why this package will never have another major version.

awesome package [type-fest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/type-fest).
